For Businesses
We know how hard it is to run a service business today. No-shows. Admin overload. Unpredictable income, spending hours replying to messages. Platforms that charge high fees but bring you no customers. ouiimi fixes this.

* A reliable 10% deposit system to reduce no-shows
* Easy service listings, availability management, and payouts

We're here to help you grow, not overwhelm you.

Our Mission
To bring the everyday services industry into the relatable modern world - with tools that are simple, fair, and built for people.
We're building a community where:
* customers feel confident
* businesses feel supported
*   and booking feels effortless
ouiimi is more than a booking platform.
It's a smarter way to manage your everyday life.

Our Promise
Simplicity.
Transparency.
Community.
Fairness.
These aren't slogans - they're the foundations ouiimi is built on.

The Meaning Behind the Name
Inspired by the spirit of "yes" - oui - and the personal connection of "me," ouiimi represents a future where booking is not only simple, but tailored for you.
It's a name that feels welcoming, positive, and modern - just like the platform itself.

Welcome to ouiimi.
