CONFUSIONS THAT NEED CLARIFICATION
-----------------------------------

CRITICAL BUSINESS LOGIC

   - Current assumption: Once per checkout

2. Business payout timing: When exactly does business receive 50% deposit?
   - Immediately after marking complete?
   - End of day batch?
   - Weekly batch?
   - Manual admin approval?

3. Time slot block-out: Exact duration during checkout?
   - "2 minutes or few seconds" - need exact time
   - What if payment takes longer than block-out?

4. Buffer time for add-ons: Exact duration?
   - "30-40 mins" - is this 30, 35, or 40 minutes?
   - Applied automatically or manually?

5. Automatic cleanup: Exact timing?
   - Past dates deleted daily at 00:00?
   - Time slots delete "at start time" - exact minute?
   - What if booking is in progress when slot should delete?
